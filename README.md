Final Project README Author: Taylor Nguyen

Please run Final_Project.R and then render Final.qmd in the R folder.

In the R Script, if there are issues running the entire code altogether, run each function individually. 

In the Quarto Doc, the description can be found at the top. The cross reference and inline R codes are after Figure 1 and before the regression tables.
